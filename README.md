## Description

My motivation and why I built this project was that I needed to learn the basics of coding and web development. By creating this project I got to learn all the main coding languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and how to do the basics with them. I learned about functions, loops, GIT commands, and so much more. I also built this project so if I ever needed somewhere to come and checkout some notes that I wrote down I could just come to the webpage and check it out rather than looking at what I have written on paper.
